# ising++

A small program to perform Ising model simulations of a ferromagnet using
mean-field approximations.

# Usage

The program is set to run with sane defaults to generate a 2D example image
when invoked with no arguments:

```
./ising++
```

But if you want, you can tailor the program to run large sims, sims of different
dimensions, saving image snapshots, and more. To see a full list of options, pass
the `--help` option:

```
./ising++ --help
```
